title: homework dominance

---

Implement some of the dominance utilities- 1) Find dominators for a function, 2)
construct the dominance tree, 3) compute the dominance frontier. Devise a way to test
your implementations. Can you find a way to confirm that block A dominates blockB.
When you code this, remember that computing these sets should be cheap while
checking their output could use slow naive algorithms.
