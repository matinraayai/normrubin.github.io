title: Homework 6 loop optimization

---

Implement and evaluate a loop optimization, either start with Bril or LLVM, you
can use the ssa form of Bril if you want. If you use Bril you will have to find the natural
loops, if you use LLVM you can call LoopPass but other parts of the implementation will
be tricker, Pick an optimization (Iâ€™d suggest loop invariant code motion) but any of the
others mentioned in class would be fine. Evaluate its performance, in Bril you can use
the Bril benchmarks, in LLVM select an existing benchmark such as Embench and feel
free to violate the sigplan guidelines SIGPLAN empirical evaluation guidelines by
cherry-picking a convenient subset.
