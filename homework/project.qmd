Half way through the course, you should submit a project proposal, I’ll review it to make
sure you are not tackling too big a challenge or going to far afield.

At the end of the course, you will complete a compiler research project. This is an open-
ended project that can be on any topic in the field of compilers.

The final product is an experience report where you rigorously evaluate the success of
your implementation.
You can work individually or in groups of 2–3 students. When you finish an
implementation, write it up.
Your writeup should answer these questions in a good degree of detail:
● What was the goal?
● What did you do? (include both the design and the implementation)
● What were the hardest parts to get right?
● Were you successful? (report rigorously on your empirical evaluation)
