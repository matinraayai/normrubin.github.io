title: Overview of Bril

## How to use Bril with real code 

1. Bril is very simple, very regular, ir. 
2. Bril can be extended easily.
1. Bril has lots of tools and examples.
1. Bril tools are written in lots of languages so setup can be messy 
 
## Lets look at a bril program.
 
Bril is written in JSON format.  Almost all programming languages have a way to read json.


```{python}
#|echo: true
import json
import subprocess
import os 
import sys


### temp 
out = subprocess.check_output('which python', shell=True)
print(out)
print('***********************')

# read from a file 
with open("images/add.json","r") as f:
    bril_program = json.load(f)

# read from a pipe
# bril_program = json.load(sys.stdin)
    
print(json.dumps(bril_program, 
    indent=2))
```

---

## Formatted 
```
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "instrs": [
        {"dest": "v0", "op": "const","type": "int","value": 1},
        {"dest": "v1", "op": "const","type": "int","value": 2},
        {"dest": "v2", "op": "add",  "type": "int","args": ["v0","v1"],},
                       "op": "print","args": [ "v2"],}],
      "name": "main",
    }
  ]
}
```

## getting started  
 
links:
 
1. [Language specification](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/bril/)
1. [github site ](https://github.com/sampsyo/bril.git)


## step 1 clone the bril repo on a linux or wsl machine 

git clone https://github.com/sampsyo/bril.git

---
 
## step 2 support packages 


1. [deno](https://deno.com/) is the runtime  for typescript/javascript
 
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
 
on my ubuntu machine   'sudo snap install deno' also worked 
 
you may need to add $HOME/.deno/bin to your $PATH.


2. [flit](https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/) a python package manager 

python3 -m pip install flit
 
 
---
 
## step 3 install the bril interpreter, and the typescript to bril compiler 
 
```
cd bril
deno install brili.ts 
deno install --allow-env --allow-read ts2bril.ts
 
```

## running the interpreter 

brili <images/add.json

brili -p <images/add.json

the -p flag turns on  profiling 

## text to json and back 

There are programs ***bril2txt*** and ***bril2json*** that make it easy to convert. Keep in mind that the json format is Bril and thats where you will do all the work. 

install text tools

~~~
cd bril-txt
flit install --symlink --user
~~~
 
run json to text 

```
bril2txt < images/add.json
```



## connect tools via pipes 

```
cat images/add.json'
bril2txt < images/add.json | bril2json
```

## Other tools

There is also a fast interpreter written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)  see docs for installation


## [turnt](https://github.com/cucapra/turnt) Tiny unified runner and tester

Bril uses [turnt](https://github.com/cucapra/turnt) as a test tool

Turnt is a simple snapshot testing tool inspired by  LLVM's lit. It's good for testing things that translate text files to other text files, like compilers. The idea is that each test is one input file, and you want to run a command and check that it still matches the saved output file.
 
pip install --user turnt

As you think about your projects, you might consider adding a new tool.
you can setup Bril on your local linux (can be wsl) machine


## Gen CFG 
 
Lets write a sample program - that generates  the cfg 

How would you do that?


```{plaintext}
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "instrs": [
        { "op": "const", "type": "int", "dest": "v0", "value": 1 },
        { "op": "const", "type": "int", "dest": "v1", "value": 2 },
        { "op": "add", "type": "int", "dest": "v2",
          "args": ["v0", "v1"] },
        { "op": "print", "args": ["v2"] }
      ],
      "args": []
    }
  ]
}

```
 
. . .
 
I'll do this in two steps
 
1. find all the basic blocks
2. add all the cfg edges 
 
You can also do this in a single step, adding cfg edges as soon as you reach the successor node.
 

## basic blocks from a list of instructions-  
keep adding instructions till we get to a terminator or a label
(do we add labels?)
 
. . . 
 
```
in: list of instrs 
out: list of lists of instrs 
 
blocks = []
curr_block = []
for each instr in list 
    if the instruction is not a label put it on curr_block
    if instr is a label or terminator 
       put curr_block on blocks
       curr_block = []
 
 if curr_block is not empty add it to blocks
 return blocks 
 ```
 
two labels in a row do not need another block
 
 
--- 

## step 2 add edges 

```
find cfg: in: is bril program in json 
for each function find the list of basic blocks
for each basic block
   get last_instr 
   if it is a terminator  br/jmp/ret 
     add edge from current block to successor  
    --- what do we want to do with call? 
   else it is a fall through
      add edge to next block
```

. . . 

we need a map (block_map) label->block so we can add edges for blocks that end in br/jmp - can build this while getting the blocks or we can put the label as  the first instruction

how do we handle  fall through? 
 
what about a return

if every block ends with a terminator, and every block has a label, then no fall through case 

what happens if try to delete the terminator (because the block never executes)


## code 

I'll use a python data structure called ***OrderedDict***, when you iterate over the items in a ordered dict,  they come back in the order that they were installed.

---

GitHub Copilot says:

OrderedDict in Python is a dictionary subclass that maintains the order in which keys are inserted. When iterating over an OrderedDict, the items are returned in the order they were added. This behavior contrasts with a standard dictionary in Python 3.6 and earlier, where the iteration order was not guaranteed. However, starting from Python 3.7, the built-in dict type also maintains insertion order by default, making OrderedDict less necessary for most applications. OrderedDict still provides additional functionality, such as the move_to_end method, which allows moving an existing key to either end of the dictionary.


## I'll use a generator 


In Python, a generator is an iterator that is defined with a function using the yield statement. 

1. Produce items only once
1. Do not store all the items in memory
1. When items from the generator are requested, the function executes until it reaches a yield statement, which produces the next value. Execution then pauses, preserving the function's state, until the next item is requested.

---


Given a list of Bril instructions, generate a sequence of
instruction lists representing the basic blocks in the program.

Every instruction in `instr` will show up in exactly one block. Jump
and branch instructions may only appear at the end of a block, and
control can transfer only to the top of a basic block---so labels
can only appear at the *start* of a basic block. Basic blocks may
not be empty.
    
---
 
```{python}
    #Instructions that terminate a basic block.
    TERMINATORS = 'br', 'jmp', 'ret'

    def form_blocks(instrs):
        # Start with an empty block.
        cur_block = []

        for instr in instrs:
            if 'op' in instr:  # It's an instruction.
                # Add the instruction to the currently-being-formed block.
                cur_block.append(instr)

                # If this is a terminator (branching instruction), it's the
                # last instruction in the block. Finish this block and
                # start a new one.
                if instr['op'] in TERMINATORS:
                    yield cur_block
                    cur_block = []
            
            else:  # It's a label.
                # End the block here (if it contains anything).
                if cur_block:
                    yield cur_block

                # Start a new block with the label.
                cur_block = [instr]

        # Produce the final block, if any.
        if cur_block:
            yield cur_block
```

## as a test, lets print out the blocks 


```{python}

def print_blocks(bril):
    """Given a Bril program, print out its basic blocks.
    """


    func = bril['functions'][0]  # We only process one function.
    for block in form_blocks(func['instrs']):
        # Mark the block.
        leader = block[0]
        if 'label' in leader:
            print( f"block {leader['label']}")
            block = block[1:]  # Hide the label
        else:
            print('anonymous block:')

        # Print the instructions.
        for instr in block:
            print(instr)

print_blocks(bril_program)
```

this test program has one block so pretty easy 

## lets try a second example with a jmp


```
@main {
  v: int = const 4;
  jmp .somewhere;
  v: int = const 2;
.somewhere:
  print v;
}
```

## running commands inside python

GitHub Copilot:
subprocess.check_output is a function in Python's subprocess module that runs a command with arguments and returns its output as a byte string. If the command exits with a non-zero exit status, it raises a CalledProcessError, which includes the exit status and output of the command. This function is useful for capturing the output of a command for further processing in Python.

---


```{python}
#| output-location: fragment
import subprocess

# Run a command and capture its output
output = subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l'])

# Convert the byte string to a regular string (assuming UTF-8 encoding)
output_str = output.decode('utf-8')

print(output_str)
```




## print the blocks 

```{python} 
#| output-location: fragment
import json 
import os
import subprocess

result =  subprocess.check_output('bril2json < images/jmp.bril', shell=True)
test2json = json.loads(result)
print_blocks(test2json)
```


## the map (label names to blocks)


```{python}
from collections import OrderedDict


def block_map(blocks):
    """Given a sequence of basic blocks, which are lists of instructions,
    produce a `OrderedDict` mapping names to blocks.

    The name of the block comes from the label it starts with, if any.
    Anonymous blocks, which don't start with a label, get an
    automatically generated name. Blocks in the mapping have their
    labels removed.
    """
    by_name = OrderedDict()

    for block in blocks:
        # Generate a name for the block.
        if 'label' in block[0]:
            # The block has a label. Remove the label but use it for the
            # block's name.
            name = block[0]['label']
            block = block[1:]
        else:
            # Make up a new name for this anonymous block.
            name = f'gen_bk_{len(by_name)}'

        # Add the block to the mapping.
        by_name[name] = block

    return by_name


blks = form_blocks(test2json['functions'][0]['instrs'])
od = block_map(blks)
for (name, instrs) in od.items():
    print (name, instrs)

```


## the cfg given the block map (pseudo code)


```{pseudo}
out cfg = {} 
# map label -> list of labels the successors of the block

for i,block in enumerate(blocks)  # blocks is a ordereddict 
    last = block[i]  # last instruction
    if last is jmp:
        cfg[block_name] = jmp.dest
    elif last is br:
        cfg[block.name] = [ last.if_label, last.else_label]
    else
        # fall through
        cfg[block_name] = blocks[i+1].name  ## special case for last block
```

## cfg  

```{python, output-location=fragment}
def get_cfg(ordered_blocks):
    cfg = {}

    labels = list(ordered_blocks.keys())

    for i, (block_name, block) in enumerate(ordered_blocks.items()):
        last = block[-1]
        op = last['op']

        if op == 'jmp':
            cfg[block_name] = last['labels']
        elif op == 'br':
            cfg[block_name] = last['labels']
        else:
            if i+1 < len(labels):  # last block does not fall through
                cfg[block_name] = [labels[i+1]]
            else:
                cfg[block_name] = []
    return cfg


blks = form_blocks(test2json['functions'][0]['instrs'])
od = block_map(blks)
cfg = get_cfg(od)

print(cfg)

## homework 

Due in 1 week



Your goal is to get familiar with Bril.

---

Part 1

Write a new benchmark.

You can write it by hand, use the TypeScript compiler, or generate it some other way.
Try running it with brili.


Use turnt --save yours.bril to create the test outputs for your new benchmark. (See the Turnt README for details.)

Start your blog post, talking about your benchmark. 


---

part 2

Write a program to analyze or transform Bril programs in some small way.
Pick your favorite programming language—there is no "starter code," so you can start from scratch.

Load up a JSON file. You can start with the tiny ones in lectures/images!
Read the docs.

Do something unambitious with it: count the number of add instructions, or add a print instruction before every jump, or whatever. Pick something small and contrived!
Use Turnt to test your new tool.

Along the way, you will run into problems! Ask questions on github discussions, use  open issues and pull requests to describe or fix problems. For example, even super simple benchmarks you might imagine probably can't be written easily because Bril is too simple. Mention this in discussions, and consider pitching in to help add features.

Think about how to write a good test, and
add to your post describing your work, submit the post on github, and finally add a link to the post in canvas, homework 1
